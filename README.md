## Project Overview

The **Movie Recommender System** aims to enhance the movie-watching experience by suggesting movies that users are likely to enjoy based on their past ratings and preferences. The system is built using a machine learning model trained on a dataset of over 5000 movies and reviews.

## Features

- **Personalized Recommendations**: Get movie suggestions tailored to your tastes.
- **Interactive Web Application**: Use Chainlit and Streamlit for a seamless user experience.
- **Comprehensive Dataset**: Trained on a dataset of more than 5000 movies and reviews.
